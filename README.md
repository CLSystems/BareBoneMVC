BareBoneMVC
===========

Basic MVC framework (OOP PHP)
This is not for starting programmers as there is no installer present at this time.

If you want to setup this MVC, you will have to manually edit config.php (or var_config.txt and rename it).

This MVC is still a bit rudimentary, but hey, it works and contains a lot of example code/modules/templates.
